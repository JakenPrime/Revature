/* 
JavaScript is not a compiled language, it's interperted
JavaScript runs in (1) the browser (2) server-side runtime like Node.JS
JavaScript is object-based (object oriented language, without classes)
ES5 uses what is call "prototypal ingeritance" to reuse behavior between objects
from ES6 onwards, JS actually does have classes
another aspect of JavaScript is dynamically typed - variables do not have a type at all
